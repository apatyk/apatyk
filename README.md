## Hi, I'm Adam 👋

I'm a software engineer passionate about machine learning, computer vision, data engineering, and scalable data processing. I enjoy using Rust, Python, and React and I'm currently learning DataFusion. When I’m not behind a computer, you can find me hiking or exploring with a camera in my hand 🏔️📷
